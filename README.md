# Shopping Assistant
Shopping Assistant is a chatbot, which can assist consumers in deciding the right product and bridge the gap between online and offline shopping. 

## Features
- It will give some suggestions to the consumer depending upon his needs, just like a salesperson.
- It will also provide a summary of all the reviews about that product, which will help the consumer to make a wise decision.
- It also helps the consumer to virtually experience fashion products. E.g. If a consumer needs to try a cloth or a spectacle our shopping assistant gives    him real time experience of how that product would look on him/her.
